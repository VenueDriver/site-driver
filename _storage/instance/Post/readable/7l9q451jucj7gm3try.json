That&rsquo;s what diners at <a href=\"http://yellowtaillasvegas.com/\">Yellowtail Las Vegas</a> encounter on the menu as they peruse Chef Akira Back&rsquo;s selections of traditional and contemporary Japanese cuisine.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Kochujang is a Korean fermented hot red pepper paste,&rdquo; says Back. &ldquo;All kochujang pastes are ranked in spiciness levels from One to Five,&rdquo; he adds. His team imports a Level Three kochujang&mdash;considered Medium-Hot&mdash;from South Korea for all of Yellowtail&rsquo;s dishes.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;For our Toro Caviar dish,&rdquo; says Back, &ldquo; we combine the kochujang paste with a Den Miso sauce&mdash;a sweet and salty Japanese fermented soy bean paste that we make in house. Combining the two creates a spicy-salty-sweet combination that pairs perfectly with the fattiness of the toro tuna and the brininess of the Osetra Caviar.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Where else will you find this spicy paste? It also pops up in the restaurant&rsquo;s seared fois gras, adding a kick to the honey glaze.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visit Hakkasan Group&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://yellowtaillasvegas.com/\">Yellowtail Las Vegas</a> to taste this red hot spice for yourself!</p>\n","importance":null,"featured image":"//s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.portaldriver.com/1865139f40b57f439c9e684784b8b567.jpg","banner image":"//s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.portaldriver.com/37f73a27d2375c3d9b26760bab7abf70.jpg"}
