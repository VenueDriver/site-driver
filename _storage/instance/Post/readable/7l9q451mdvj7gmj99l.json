Ultra-fresh local fish, produce and meats are on the menu. And as diners at the new restaurant&rsquo;s opening party this month noticed, the music choices are local, too. Hawaiian artist <a href=\"https://www.kimieminer.com/\">Kimi&eacute; Miner</a> was there serenading guests all evening long. We touched base with the award-winning singer-songwriter her songs so far, her upcoming album, and what keeps pulling her back to Hawai&rsquo;i.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You started singing at age 14. Was making a career out of it always part of the picture?</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pretty much as soon as I could speak, I was singing. I started playing ukulele as a young kid, then came guitar and then songwriting my own music at 14. I started out because I loved it and was passionate about it. Music is such a big part of our culture in Hawai&rsquo;i so it was natural. I didn&rsquo;t know I wanted to make it my career until I stepped off my first big stage at age 19 in Santa Clara, CA opening for reggae singer &nbsp;Barrington Levy.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You went to school in California...what made you come back to Hawaii?</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My connection to this place is so special. No matter where I&#39;ve traveled, from California to Jamaica and Hong Kong, I always felt Hawai&rsquo;i calling to me, drawing me back home...to the water, to my family, and our beautiful home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When writing a song, how do you decide when it&rsquo;s ready, when it&rsquo;s &ldquo;done&rdquo;?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a songwriter and producer, I can edit and re-edit the same song for years. Usually the business side of my brain kicks in and I realize I need to release it already! &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your songs bring up the Hawaiian notion of &ldquo;piko,&rdquo; can you explain what that means? How can music share this idea?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Piko is all about the connection we have from birth. Our piko, or navel, connects us with our mother and with our land as Hawaiians. No matter where we go along our routes, we always have our roots. When we have this connection to our source, then we can share our culture through every form of art. Music is my form of art.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite part about living in Hawaii?</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That I get to wake up in paradise everyday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s one misconception about Hawaii you think visitors should know?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are a growing metropolis island with much more diversity to share in the realm of food, fashion, and music then what they may see in TV, movies or game shows. My new company, <a href=\"http://www.hakuhawaii.com/\">Haku Hawai&rsquo;i</a>, provides direct access to the emerging and established artists here in Hawai&rsquo;i. Its Haku Collective is reaching across genres and driving the evolution of Hawaiian music and sound today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve been working on a new album this summer&mdash;what&rsquo;s that process like? Where do you find inspiration for new songs?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always been inspired by my surroundings. Particularly on this album, I drew from my experiences as a traveling native Hawaiian living in today&rsquo;s world. I also drew from the issues closer to home on Mauna Kea, enjoying our natural resources at the beach, in a forest and even watching a lightning storm take place in Kohala on my home island of Hawai&rsquo;i, the Big Island.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What should listeners expect on your new album?</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My album comes out this fall! It will include a new single, &ldquo;Bamboo&rdquo; and a cover of &ldquo;Sea of Love.&rdquo; The album&rsquo;s a mix of acoustic, soul, pop, reggae, and R&amp;B. Lyrically and musically it touches on my roots and the musical styles here in Hawai&rsquo;i, as well as my experiences traveling away from home.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />\nStay up to date on Miner&rsquo;s latest announcements at <a href=\"https://www.kimieminer.com/\">kimieminer.com</a>.</p>\n","importance":null,"featured image":"//s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.portaldriver.com/1865139f40b57f439c9e684784b8b567.jpg","banner image":"//s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.portaldriver.com/37f73a27d2375c3d9b26760bab7abf70.jpg"}
